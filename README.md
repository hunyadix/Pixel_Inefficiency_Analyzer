CMSSW Pixel Detector Inefficiency Analysis. This package works on the output Ntuple generated by the TimingStudy framework.

Usage: put your "Ntuple.root" file in the "Data" directory, or specify the input with the -input-file/-i switch. The default 
outputfile is called "Innefficiency_Analysis_Results.root" and can be found in the "Results" directory. You may also specify
the output by using the --output-file/-o switch.

*Note: this package uses ANSI colour formatting for its console output. To make sure that you are being sent the
desirable output messages, please use a modern terminal (or at least one that supports ANSI colours).*
